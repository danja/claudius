# Claudius second voice plan

1) Review current parameter flow (UI→DSP), display/menu behavior, and DSP engine to identify extension points for a second voice and new parameter mappings.
2) Design the new voice algorithm, decide its parameters, and extend message/parameter metadata to support voice selection and new params.
3) Implement the new DSP voice and voice selection in the engine; update DSP task to use pitch CV only and map knobs/params appropriately.
4) Implement the menu system behavior in UI/display (title line paging, item selection) and surface new parameters/voice selection.
